## Features:
- Loading Screen:
  
  Loading screen appears while content is loading, within the JavaScript I used the eventListener "load" as oppposed to "DomContentLoaded" as I wanted the JavaScript file to render also.
  There is a slight animation on the "o" that is in the shape of a doughnut chart style.

- Error Screen:
  
  ![Errpr message screen](assets/documentation/errormessage.jpg)
  ![Errpr message console screen](assets/documentation/errorMessageConsole.jpg)

  In the event that a user does receive an error the error message has instructions on what actions to take (refresh page) and if that continues to fail, there is a call to action within the error(mail:to link)
  The error is also intentinoally logged to the console. I remvoed the error details from the screen as to not include "technical jargon" to the user.
